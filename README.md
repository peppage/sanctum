# Sanctum - Hugo Theme

Sanctum is a game review theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I'm still working on it.

## Installation

To install Sanctum run the following command inside your Hugo site:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/peppage/sanctum.git sanctum
```

Or

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git submodule add https://github.com/peppage/sanctum.git sanctum
```

> You can also download the last release [here](https://github.com/peppage/sanctum/releases).

Back to your Hugo site directory open the _config.toml_ file and add the following line:

```toml
theme = "sanctum"
```

## Archetypes

Sanctum includes only one usable archetype:

- _review_: for game reviews
